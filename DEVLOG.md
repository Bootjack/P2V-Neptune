# P2V-7S Neptune — Development Log

## 2026-06-13 ~20:00 — Phase 0: Project Scaffold

### Codebase tour & planning
- Explored the A-4E-C community mod as a structural reference for building a DCS aircraft mod
- Key architecture: `entry.lua` → `declare_plugin` / `make_flyable` / `plugin_done`; cockpit devices in Lua; flight model in C++ DLL
- Decided on P2V-7S (SP-2H) variant: twin R-3350 radials + twin J34 jet pods, full ASW suite
- Multi-crew is not available to community modders — ASW crew stations will be AI-automated
- Decided to go EFM from day one (skip SFM), stub out flight model, focus on systems depth
- 3D model approach: hybrid blockout — rough proportions, real panel faces, refined over time
- Official Blender EDM exporter available from Eagle Dynamics on GitHub

### Scaffold created
- Created full project structure at `D:\Projects\Coding\community-p2v-7s\P2V-7S\`
- 22 files: entry.lua, aircraft definition, views, comm, suspension, cockpit scripts (devices, commands, mainpanel, device_init, EFM data bus), input bindings, livery/options/weapons stubs
- `devices.lua` defines 30 device IDs upfront (electrical through ASW systems) so IDs stay stable
- `command_defs.lua` reserves ranges: standard DCS commands + custom 10000+ and device 3000+
- Deploy strategy: symlink/junction from DCS Saved Games to project directory

## 2026-06-14 ~00:00 — First DCS load attempt

### Crash #1: Sound path mount
- DCS crashed immediately after mounting empty `Sounds/` directory
- Fix: commented out `mount_vfs_sound_path` in entry.lua
- Also noted `mount_vfs_sound_path()` is marked OBSOLETE by DCS — other mods (A-4E-C, AJS37) still use it with just a warning

### Crash #2: Missing `Tasks` field
- Real error found in dcs.log: `ALERT Dispatcher: Error running db_scan: attempt to get length of field 'Tasks' (a nil value)`
- `P2V-7S.lua` aircraft definition was missing `Tasks` and `DefaultTask` — DCS's `db_mods.lua` requires these
- Fix: added `Tasks = { aircraft_task(AntishipStrike), aircraft_task(GroundAttack), aircraft_task(Reconnaissance) }` and `DefaultTask`

### Crash #3: Stale symlink
- Git Bash `ln -s` created a copy, not a live symlink — edits weren't reflected at the DCS mod path
- Fix: use Windows directory junction instead (`mklink /J` via cmd.exe, or PowerShell `deploy.ps1`)
- Key lesson: always use `mklink /J` (junction) or PowerShell `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink` on Windows — Git Bash symlinks don't work for Windows apps
- Verify junction is live: `type "D:\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Mods\aircraft\P2V-7S\P2V-7S.lua" | findstr Tasks`

## 2026-06-14 ~01:00 — Phase 0 complete: mod loads in DCS

### Fixed the deploy link
- The mod dir in `Mods\aircraft\` was a stale copy from `deploy.sh` (Git Bash) — its contents weren't updating/being found. `deploy.ps1` had never run successfully.
- Two issues stopped `deploy.ps1`: (1) it used `-ItemType SymbolicLink` (needs admin) — switched to `-ItemType Junction` (no elevation, same-volume; matches CLAUDE.md); (2) PS execution policy blocked the unsigned script ("not digitally signed"). Run via `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy.ps1`; persistent fix is `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`.

### Phase 0 end state reached (as designed)
- With a live junction, P2V-7S shows in the modules bar, is selectable in the mission editor, and a mission with it loads.
- As expected for a model-less scaffold: the client slot is dropped and nothing renders, because `Shapes/` has no `P2V-7S.edm` (`Shape = "P2V-7S"` is unresolvable). The full Lua plugin pipeline is now proven end to end.
- Phase 1 starts with a blockout `.edm` so the slot survives and the aircraft renders.
- Set up art workflow: working files (`.blend`, reference, texture source) live in `Source/` (never shipped); exterior model exports to `P2V-7S/Shapes/P2V-7S.edm`. See `Source/README.md`.

## 2026-06-14 ~05:00 — Phase 1: first model crashes on spawn (collision/damage)

### Crash #4: Corrupt damage model → ACCESS_VIOLATION
- First exterior `.edm` exported into `Shapes/`. DCS loaded the model fine, then crashed on spawn (`C0000005 ACCESS_VIOLATION`).
- dcs.log root cause:
  - `WORLDGENERAL: Unit [P2V-7S]: No property record for cell "Collision_Gear_Nose"` (also `_Main_Left`, `_Main_Right`)
  - `APP: Unit [P2V-7S]: Corrupt damage model.` → dump written
- Two-sided cause: (1) the model's collision-shell objects used invented names (`Collision_Gear_*`); DCS only accepts names from its fixed cell vocabulary in `DCS\Scripts\Aircrafts\_Common\Damage.lua`. (2) `P2V-7S.lua` had `Damage = {}`, so even a correct name had no property record.
- Key lesson: a collision shell's **object name** maps via `damage_cells` to a numbered cell, which must have a matching entry in the aircraft's `Damage` table. Name ↔ cell ↔ property record must all agree, or the damage model is "corrupt" and spawning crashes.

### Fix applied
- `P2V-7S.lua`: replaced `Damage = {}` with `verbose_to_dmg_properties{...}` (the A-4E-C pattern) covering gear cells `GEAR_FRONT` (8), `GEAR_L` (15), `GEAR_R` (16), plus stub hull cells `NOSE_CENTER`/`MAIN`/`TAIL` for later.
- Blender TODO: rename the three collision shells to `GEAR_FRONT` / `GEAR_L` / `GEAR_R` and re-export. Likely next: add a fuselage collision shell named `MAIN` for a stable ground/collision hull.
- Reference: gear names recognized by DCS — nose `FRONT_GEAR_BOX`/`GEAR_FRONT`/`STOIKA_F`; left `LEFT_GEAR_BOX`/`GEAR_L`/`STOIKA_L`; right `RIGHT_GEAR_BOX`/`GEAR_R`/`STOIKA_R`.

## 2026-06-14 — Phase 1: FIRST SUCCESSFUL SPAWN (the crash #6 saga)

### The bug
- After fixing the damage model, the P2V kept crashing at spawn: `C0000005 ACCESS_VIOLATION at …167` in `Common::FSM::onSymbol_ → enterToState_ → sendOutputSymbol_`, fired the instant `MissionSpawn:spawnPlanes` ran. The faulting address was `00:00000000` — a textbook **null-pointer deref**.
- **Root cause: `P2V-7S.lua` had no `SFM_Data` block.** With `AFMenabled = false`, both the SFM and the AI flight model are built from `SFM_Data` (aerodynamics polar + engine table) at spawn. With it absent, the flight-model FSM dereferenced null on instantiation. Added a placeholder `SFM_Data` (classic format: `aerodynamics.table_data` M/Cx0/Cya/B/B4/Omxmax/Aldop/Cymax + `engine` with thrust `table_data`) → **it spawned, rendered, and the AI flew toward its waypoint.**

### Why it took so long (and the lessons)
- The crash address was **byte-identical across every change** — empty model, render-only model, render+collision, a *known-good A-4E-C model swapped in*, A-4E-C flight params, `make_flyable` on/off, AI-only vs flyable, ground vs airborne, Caucasus vs Mariana, single unit, A-4E-C mod disabled. Nothing moved it.
- Lesson — **a frozen crash address = many causes funnel through one shared init path.** `Common::FSM` is a generic engine primitive; dozens of unrelated misconfigs all crash at the same `enterToState_` when the unit's state machines come online at spawn. Reading the address tells you *where*, never *why*; only isolation by elimination does.
- Lesson — **a model that *renders* is not a model that *spawns*.** The `.edm` showed fine in the ME loadout preview (pure graphics path) the whole time; the crash was in unit instantiation, which the preview never exercises. Don't trust "it renders" as "the model is fine."
- The decisive move: **swapping a known-good A-4E-C `.edm` AND its flight params in behind our own definition** — both still crashed → conclusively exonerated the model AND the param values → pointed at the one block neither provided: `SFM_Data` (the A-4E-C has one even though it's EFM).
- Tooling: verified `.edm` contents with `pdftotext`/`grep` of node-type strings (`model::RenderNode`, `ShellNode`, `LodNode`), but learned binary fields (bounding box, `SFM_Data` is Lua not model) aren't greppable — string-grep checks node *types*, not everything.

### Bugs fixed along the way (crash #5 and model-export issues)
- **Crash #5** — the `Damage` table and collision shells must be an *exact 1:1 set*: extra `Damage` keys with no matching shell throw `No cell for property records … → Corrupt damage model`. Trimmed `Damage` to exactly the shells present.
- **Empty `.edm` (541 bytes)** — meshes were silently dropped on export because they had **no EDM material**. Assigning EDM materials made `RenderNode` geometry appear (37 KB).
- **`Bounding_Box`/`User_Box`** — must be **Empty Cubes** in a **scene collection** (Outliner/View-Layer, checkbox enabled — *not* an object/group collection), with `Obj.Type` set via the EDM N-panel dropdown (not a `TYPE=` custom property). Required scene structure: `Export` root → `LOD_0_50` (meshes) + `Collision` (shells) + the two boxes.

### Current state
- P2V-7S spawns as AI, renders, and flies (rough placeholder SFM). `P2V-7S.lua` rolled back from the A-4 diagnostic clone to real P2V values; debugging changes reverted; `SFM_Data` placeholder + `WorldID` kept. `sounderName` still disabled (no sound files yet — crash #1). Textures show DCS "missing" placeholders (model is untextured — expected).
- Next: real cockpit `.edm` + clickable framework (Phase 2), and eventually the EFM (`Neptune.dll`) to replace the placeholder `SFM_Data`.

## 2026-06-16 to 2026-06-19 — Phase 1: Cockpit integration

### Getting a player into the seat

#### Shape name must match filename exactly
- `mainpanel_init.lua:shape_name` must equal the `.edm` filename without extension. Our export was `Cockpit_P2V-7S.edm` but `shape_name = "Cockpit_P2V7S"` (no hyphen) → `ERROR GRAPHICSVISTA: Can't open model Cockpit_P2V7S`. Fixed to `"Cockpit_P2V-7S"`. DCS resolves shape by filename; there is no embedded name in the EDM to match against.

#### White-screen / glare in an untextured cockpit
- `EDM_Default_Material` has a white albedo. The cockpit lighting path (flat `ambient_light = {255,255,255}`) causes untextured surfaces to blow out under HDR bloom, making the interior look like solid white glare. The external model is fine because it uses a different lighting path. Fix: assign a dark-gray diffuse material in Blender. The `ambient_light` reference value from A-4E-C is correct; don't lower it permanently.

#### How DCS places the cockpit model and pilot head
- **`CockpitLocalPoint` for view `[1]`** does two things: it places the cockpit EDM's world origin at that position in airframe coordinates, AND it sets the camera there. The EDM's origin must therefore be modeled at the pilot's head (eye position).
- **`CockpitLocalPoint` for view `[2]` and beyond** sets only the camera position in airframe coordinates. The cockpit geometry does not move. Confirmed in-game: changing view 2's `CockpitLocalPoint` shifted only the player camera, leaving the cockpit model fixed.
- **`EyePoint`** is a fine-tune offset from `CockpitLocalPoint` but is clamped by `limits_6DOF`. Cannot be used for large displacements (e.g., left-seat to right-seat offset) without widening the limits.
- **`limits_6DOF`** is in metres. The A-4E-C values (`x={-0.10,0.40}`, `y={-0.30,0.15}`, `z={-0.25,0.25}`) represent normal in-seat head lean range. Setting them to ±20 is a useful diagnostic to fly the camera around and locate geometry, but makes MMB pan hypersensitive.

#### `use_external_views`
- `use_external_views = false` in `mainpanel_init.lua` disables F2 external view from the human cockpit. Set to `true` to allow it. (The flag had no effect when the aircraft was AI-only because the cockpit script wasn't loaded.)

### Input bindings

#### `LockOn_Options` is nil in the input binding context
- Input binding scripts run in a LuaGUI context where `LockOn_Options` does not exist. Referencing it crashes the script on line 1, silently discarding all custom bindings — DCS falls back to engine defaults with no error visible to the user. The error appears in `dcs.log` as `attempt to index global 'LockOn_Options' (a nil value)`.
- Fix: use the DCS-injected global `folder` directly (as A-4E-C does): `local cscripts = folder.."../../Cockpit/Scripts/"`.

#### Other input binding pitfalls found
- The keyboard `default.lua` must load `common_keyboard_binding.lua`, not `common_joystick_binding.lua`.
- `category` in binding entries must be a table: `category = {_('Systems')}`, not a bare string.

#### Crew seat switching
- `iCommandViewCockpitChangeSeat` (ID 1602) is a DCS engine global injected into all input binding contexts. Not defined in any mod file — use the bare name. `value_down = N` selects station N.
- Related globals (all engine-level): `iCommandViewCockpitSetPilotSeat = 1603`, `iCommandViewCockpitSetOperatorSeat = 1604`, `iCommandViewCockpitSetGunnerSeat1 = 1605`, `iCommandViewCockpitSetGunnerSeat2 = 1606`.
- Multiple `ViewSettings.Cockpit[N]` entries + corresponding `SnapViews[N]` + `crew_members[N]` in `P2V-7S.lua` are all required for additional stations to be functional.

### Current state
- Player can occupy the pilot seat (view 1) and switch to the copilot seat (view 2) via the `2` key. F2 external view works. Input bindings appear correctly in DCS Controls under their categories.
- Cockpit geometry is a rough blockout; still untextured (dark-gray material applied to suppress glare).

## 2026-06-27 — Phase 1 final: first clickable instrument (proof-of-concept ammeter)

### What was built
- **Clickable framework scaffolding** — `clickable_defs.lua` (TUMB helper), `clickabledata.lua` (elements table). DCS loads `clickabledata.lua` automatically alongside `mainpanel_init.lua`; no explicit dofile needed.
- **Battery toggle switch** — `elements["PNT_BATTERY_SW"]`, `device_commands.BatterySwitch` (ID 3000), arg 50 in the 3D model. `default_2_position_tumb` sends value=+1 (on) or -1 (off) to `SetCommand`. `updatable=true` allows the device to sync the arg position back (used for HOT start).
- **Ammeter gauge** — `parameter_name = "AMMETER"`, arg 51. Reads a normalized −1…+1 value exported by `electric_system.lua` via `get_param_handle("AMMETER")`. −1 = full discharge left, 0 = zero (center), +1 = full charge right.
- **Simplified electrical model** — Battery OFF → 0 A. Battery ON with no alternator → −0.5 (−30 A / 60 A full-scale), needle half-left. Alternator will pull it positive when added later.
- **Keyboard ↔ clickable sync** — keyboard shortcut (`LShift+B`, Keys.BatteryPower) calls `performClickableAction(BatterySwitch, ±1, true)` to move the 3D switch without double-firing SetCommand.
- **HOT start** — `post_initialize` detects `GROUND_HOT`/`AIR_HOT` and sets battery ON + syncs switch arg.

### Blender side (still needed)
For the Lua to animate anything visible, the cockpit EDM needs two new animated objects:
- **Battery switch handle** — set its EDM argument to **50**; keyframe arg=0 at OFF position, arg=1 at ON position.
- **Ammeter needle** — set its EDM argument to **51**; keyframe at arg=−1 (full left rotation), arg=0 (center/up), arg=+1 (full right rotation).

### Architecture lesson learned
The clickable data flow in DCS:
1. Player clicks element in `clickabledata.lua` → DCS updates the model arg directly via `arg_value` and `arg_lim`.
2. DCS also calls `SetCommand(command, value)` on the device specified by `elements[...].device`.
3. Device script updates internal state; exports named params via `get_param_handle`.
4. `mainpanel_init.lua` `CreateGauge("parameter")` gauges read those params each frame and drive their `arg_number` in the model.
- Switch arg (50): driven by clicks and `performClickableAction` — no gauge needed.
- Needle arg (51): driven by the "AMMETER" parameter gauge in `mainpanel_init.lua` each frame.
